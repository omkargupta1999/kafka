Subject: NEFT Inbound MQ – Queue Manager & Listener Mapping Clarification

Hi Team,

NEFT **outbound (Kafka → MQ) connectivity is working successfully** using the details shared earlier.

However, **NEFT inbound (MQ → Kafka)** connection is failing with the below error:

`MQRC_Q_MGR_NAME_ERROR (2058)`

This indicates a mismatch between the **queue manager name and the listener (host/port)** for the inbound flow.

Kindly confirm the **exact inbound MQ connection details** for **NeftInboundQueue**:

* Queue Manager name
* Host / IP
* Port
* SVRCONN channel

Once the correct inbound QM–host–port mapping is confirmed, we will update Kafka Connect and re-test immediately.

Thanks,
**Saadi**
