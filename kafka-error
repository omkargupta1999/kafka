Subject: NEFT Inbound MQ – Queue Manager & Listener Clarification

Hi Team,

We are getting the below error while connecting to **NEFT inbound MQ**:

`MQRC_Q_MGR_NAME_ERROR (2058)`

This indicates a mismatch between the **queue manager name and the listener (host/port)**.

Kindly confirm the **exact inbound MQ connection details** for **NeftInboundQueue**:

* Queue Manager name
* Host / IP
* Port
* SVRCONN channel

Once the correct QM–host–port mapping is confirmed, we will update Kafka Connect and re-test immediately.

Thanks,
**Saadi**
