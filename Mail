point no 3 -->> Database Activity:  Database move from DC Side to DR Side
                 ==>>  "The document mentioned a DB switchover time of five minutes, but it should be completed within three to four minutes. We can minimize this time by                                           assigning a second DBA: one can manage the GoldenGate services while the other performs the database switchover."

point no 4 -->> Kafka Miror Maker 2 Activity:
          ==>> "If possible We can start this activity in parallel with the DB switchover, as soon as all services on the DC side have been stopped."

point no 5 -->> All application Services are started at DR site
                ==>>  "To speed things up, we can start the services while the DB switchover is happening. We can then keep those services running, and once the database                                        convert  is in read/write mode, connections will be established instantly."

point no 6 -->> All topics are reflected in DR
                ==>>  "We can perform this activity during the period specified in point 4."
