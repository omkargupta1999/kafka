If you want, I can:

provide a ready-to-use deploy-all-charts job that detects changed charts in the MR and runs helm upgrade sequentially with logging (helm status + kubectl events) built in; or

convert your current multi-job pipeline to use resource_group and show the minimal .gitlab-ci.yml diff for your repo.

Which would help you most — a sequential job script or resource_group modifications for your existing jobs?
