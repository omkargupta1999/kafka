1. Start Maintenance service page in DC and DR
2. Wait until its propagated
3. Go for DNS change
4. check if traffic to frontend and P1services like transaction services < 1% of previous traffic
5. if no wait for it to go down. if yes, start DB replication
6. Enable kafka mirror maker
7. Once 5 and 6 are done
8. Start DR services by increasing replica count by deployment repo MR
9. Once sanity testing is done in DR, remove maintenance service in DR
10. Once traffic is steady, stop DC services replica count including maintenance (this step is optional)
11. if any step fails rollback dns to DC

Vice versa for DR to DC
