Subject: NEFT MQ Inbound – Intermittent Queue Manager Mapping Issue

Hi Team,

NEFT **outbound (Kafka → MQ) Sink connector is working successfully** and remains stable using the details shared.

However, **NEFT inbound (MQ → Kafka) Source connector intermittently moves between READY and NOTREADY states**.

**Observed error during failure:**
`MQRC_Q_MGR_NAME_ERROR (2058)`

This indicates that the listener at **10.176.10.213:2001** intermittently does not correspond to the queue manager **SBIEPAY_NEFT_INWARD**, leading to connection failure during reconnect attempts.

**Request your support to confirm one of the following for NEFT inbound:**

1. A **stable/dedicated listener (host:port)** mapped only to queue manager **SBIEPAY_NEFT_INWARD**, OR
2. The **correct queue manager name** that consistently listens on port **2001**, OR
3. A **VIP/DNS/CCDT-based endpoint** that always resolves to the active instance of **SBIEPAY_NEFT_INWARD**.

Once a stable inbound MQ endpoint is confirmed, we will update Kafka Connect and re-validate immediately.

Thanks & Regards,
**Saadi**
